          <h6>My name is Pierre. I was born in <a href=http://www.newmilford.org>New Milford, Connecticut"</a> on 11/11/1980. I like to hike, 
          walk on empty beaches, and read works of fiction. I also like works in philosophy, and western history, 
          particularly the ancients. I have an ever growing library, and an ever growing list of books I'd like to read. 
          I plan to live long enough so I can get through most of them. In my time I've had some varied and interesting 
          jobs. My most gainful employment has been as a bartender, working at some great places including;
          <The Pequot Inn>, <The Mayflower Inn>, <The Roger Sherman Inn> <The Cobb's Mill Inn>, and <Le Chateau Restaurant>. 
          My experiences at these places were formative and lasting. People have asked me for stories, but part of the job
          is never telling too much! I can say that the high point of my career was serving a cat, water, from a monkey dish, 
          at the downstairs bar of <Harry's New York Bar, Paris>! It was downhill from there. I also had temporary roles in the 
          Legal Department of <UBS Investment Bank>, and also in their <Wealth Management Unit>, and once took seasonal employment 
          as a package loader at <UPS>. One of my more interesting gigs was a summer job working for a movie catering company 
          on such films as; <a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976238>Old Dogs</a>, <a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0997047>College Road Trip</a>, and <Indiana Jones and the Cystal Skull>. While working there I saw the man
          who would in nine years, become president of the <United States>, <Donald Trump>. There were many others who I will not 
          name, but one thing I learned from each of these jobs is that some of the lowest positions offer the best perspectives. 
          If you aren't important, you will often learn about things well above your pay grade, and usually, no one will care.  
          Along the way I've gotten degrees from <Naugatuck Valley Community College> and <Ball State Unihversity> -- GO Cardinals! 
          For the past three years while finishing my Bachelor's I have been driving an <Uber> through-out <Connecticut>. Out of necessity 
          I learned how to fix my car, mostly from <You Tube> videos and then getting my hands and everything else, dirty. And in 
          the past two months I have started learning to code, one of the most challenging things I have ever done, and 
          I hope it will also be one of the most rewarding.
